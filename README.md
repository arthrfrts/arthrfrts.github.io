# Personal Website

This is my public GitHub showcase, available at <https://arthr.dev>. It hosts my most recent projects and current interests.

It's mostly a [Jekyll website](https://jekyllrb.com) hosted with GitHub Pages and using the GitHub API to grab my account data. If you want to read what I'm writing these days, visit my blog at <https://arthr.me/>.
